<h2>Part 1: Creating an App and Adding Data into Splunk</h2>
<br />

<b>Steps:</b> 

<p>1. I logged in to Splunk using admin credentials.</p>
<p>2. On the left side of the page, under the Apps section, I clicked on Manage.</p>
<p>3. In the top right corner of the screen, I clicked on Create app.</p>
<p>4. I named the app and entered a folder name, leaving other values as default, and clicked Save.</p>
<p>5. Once created, I selected the app to ensure all subsequent actions are within its scope.</p>
<p>6. To select the app, I clicked on the Apps dropdown list at the top left and chose the app.</p>
<p>7. With the app selected, I navigated to Settings > Add Data.</p>
<p>8. For this exercise, I chose to monitor a directory to capture data generated by the web server. I clicked on Monitor.</p>
<p>9. Selecting Files & Directories, I browsed to /var/log and chose the weblogs directory, clicking Select.</p>
<p>10. I confirmed the directory path (/var/log/weblogs) and clicked Next.</p>
<p>11. On the Input Settings screen, I selected a source type by clicking Select next to Source type, choosing Web > access_combined from the dropdown list.</p>
<p>12. I ensured the new app was selected for App Context.</p>
<p>13. Leaving other settings as default, I clicked Review.</p>
<p>14. After reviewing, I clicked Submit.</p>
<p>15. A message confirmed the successful creation of the file input. I clicked Start Searching to explore the data in Splunk.</p>
<p>16. I verified raw events were displayed in Splunk.</p>

<b>Exploring my Data</b> 
<p>In this exercise, I explored basic Splunk searches using the Search section of my new app.</p>

<p>In the Splunk environment:</p>

 
<p>•503 purchase searches for events containing the status code "503" and the word "purchase".</p>

<p align="center">

</p>


<p>•503 pur searches for events containing the status code "503" and the fragment "pur"..</p>

<p align="center">
<img src="https://imgur.com/qUYX1xJ.png" height="65%" width="65%" alt=""/>
</p>


<p>Difference: 503 purchase finds events with the full word "purchase," while 503 pur finds events with any word starting with "pur," like "purchase," "purchased," or "purchasing"..</p>
</p>

<br />


<h2>Part 2: IT Operations team: Investigate successful vs unsuccessful web server requests over time
</h2>
<br />

<b>Description:
The IT Operations team at Buttercup Enterprises currently lacks visibility into website failures.</b> 

<b>Steps:</b> 

<p>1. Selecting my app from the Apps dropdown, I clicked Search on the app menu bar.</p>

<p>2. I searched the main index for web server events over the last 60 minutes: `index=main sourcetype=access_combined`.</p>

<p>3. I located the status field, clicked it, and selected Top values by time.</p>
<p>4. Splunk populated my search: `index=main sourcetype=access_combined | timechart count by status limit=10`.</p>
<p>5. Changing the visualisation to a Column Chart on the Visualisation tab.</p>
<p>6. Clicking Format, I went to the General tab and set the Stack Mode to 'stacked'. I adjusted formatting as necessary.</p>
<p>7. I saved the chart to a new dashboard via Save As > New Dashboard.</p>
<p>8. Naming the dashboard appropriately (e.g., 'Buttercup Enterprises') and adding a description if needed.</p>
<p>9. Using Dashboard Studio with Absolute layout mode.</p>
<p>10. I titled the panel appropriately (e.g., 'IT Ops - Web Server Status Codes Over Time').</p>
<p>11. Clicking Save to Dashboard, then View Dashboard.</p>

<h2>Part 3 – DevOps team: Show the most common customer operating systems and which web browsers are experiencing the most failures
</h2>
<br />

<b>Description:
In this exercise, I extracted a new field from events using Splunk’s field extractor wizard.
</b> 

<p>Custom field extractions are useful in various scenarios, such as: </p> 

<p>•When I have custom data and Splunk did not recognize/extract a particular field that I need.</p> 

<p>•When I need to extract a specific part of an event to search/report on that value.</p> 

<b>Extract a New Field</b> 

<b>Steps:</b> 

<p>1. Click Search if the search bar isn't displayed.</p>

<p>2. Search for web server events from the last 60 minutes: `index=main sourcetype=access_combined`.</p>

<p>3. Click the arrow (>) next to an event timestamp to expand it.</p>
<p>4. Click the Event Actions dropdown and select Extract Fields.</p>
<p>5. Choose Regular Expression and click Next.</p>
<p>6. In the sample event, find and highlight the platform (operating system) info in the useragent string.</p>
<p>7. Name the new field "platform" (use all lowercase).</p>
<p>8. Click Add Extraction, then click Next.</p>
<p>9. Click Next again to reach the Save screen, then click Finish.</p>
<p>10. On the Success page, click Explore the fields I just created in Search.</p>
<p>11. Splunk will show search results for the last 24 hours. Scroll down to see your new field listed on the left. </p>
